        <item>Many things can cause lethargy, including major problems, such as heart disease.\nIt may be necessary to visit the vet, especially if other symptoms arise, such as change in exercise tolerance, weakness, collapse, or loss of consciousness.</item>
        <item>Chronic coughing may be related to heart disease, heartworms, or lung diseases.\nIf a puppy or dog with kennel cough develops more serious symptoms, such as fever, nasal discharge, loss of appetite, lethargy, or a productive cough, it may be getting pneumonia.</item>
